p3b CONCLUSIONS.TXT

Complete p3b and answer the following questions using results of running JDK Mission Control to justify your conclusions..

1) What can you tell about the performance of your hash table implementation compared to Java's tree map? 
Explain why (or when) your hash table is better or worse than Java's Tree Map.

My HashTable is worse than the treemap. First, the treemap only requires 1014 cpu cycles, but my HashTable requires 4793 cycles.
Second, the treemap only use 330MiB memory, but my HashTable use 2.4GiB memory. 
So the treemap is better on either space or time.

2) What did you observe in jdk mission control to come to the conclusion above?

The number of cycles for my HashTable is much more larger than that of treemap.
Also, in Method polling, my HashTable class uses 1299 cpu cycles and the treemap class only uses 229.

3) SCREENSHOT_001.PNG NOTES: Briefly describe what this image 001 shows

The put method from treemap has less count of cpu cycles (1,303) than the insert method from HashTable (3,776).

4) SCREENSHOT_002.PNG NOTES: Briefly describe what this image 002 shows

Treemap has less memory usage (1,015) than hashtable has (2,787).

5) Describe other screenshots if you include them in your submission.
